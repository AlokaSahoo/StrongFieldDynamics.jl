# StrongFieldDynamics

Documentation for [StrongFieldDynamics](https://github.com/AlokaSahoo/StrongFieldDynamics.jl).

A Julia package for studying intense laser-atom interactions under strong field approximation using the partial wave approximation approach. 

The package provides several approaches to consider the influence of atomic potential to the ionized electron.

With the future scope to include HHG and other processes into account.
